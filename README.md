#Approach Taken

- I started by drawing out  a wireframe for this application using draw.io.
- I made a planning board using Trello to keep track of the progress of the project.
- I created models( in this project I only had one model), views, and controllers for the app. Full CRUD was achieved using AngularJS.
- Authorization and authentication has not been included in this application.
- Lastly, after all the debugging, the application was deployed to Heroku.
