# Approach Taken

- I started by drawing out  a wireframe for this application using draw.io.
- I made a planning board using Trello to keep track of the project progress.
- I created data model (in this case there is only one model), views, and controllers for the application. Full CRUD was achieved using AngularJS.
- Authorization and authentication has not been included in this application.
- Lastly, after all the debugging, the application was deployed to Heroku.
